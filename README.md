# My-journey-thus-far
Hello, everyone! Here's a little but about me:
I am 25 years old (Born Sep. 98) and I have worked hard as a chef for nearly 8 years. I have grown exhausted and unrewarded in my current industry and so I feel that my brain can and will be channeled to something more productive and 100x more rewarding.
This repository will contain links and updates to projects that i either currently have a hand in or have helped develop. 
I really appreciate the time you've taken to read this.
